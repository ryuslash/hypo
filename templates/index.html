      <p>
        This is hypo. Hypo is supposed to be an easy way to share/store
        code snippets and other files.
      </p>

      <div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
        <h2 id="sec-1">Usage</h2>
        <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
          <p>
            Once setup it will not show much of anything, first you'll
            have to upload something.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
          <h3 id="sec-1-1">Uploading</h3>
          <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
            <p>
              Uploading is done with the <code>PUT</code> HTTP method.
              An example with curl:
            </p>

            <pre class="example"># curl --upload-file README.org http://yourserver.example.com/ 2&gt;/dev/null
http://yourserver.example.com/abcdef1</pre>

            <p>
              After uploading a file to the server it will respond
              with the url of your newly uploaded file. If you browse
              to this URL using your favorite browser you will find a
              page showing the file. For text files it will try to
              provide some syntax highlighting, for certain types of
              images (currently <code>jpg</code>, <code>png</code>
              and <code>gif</code>) it will show the image.
            </p>

            <p>
              If Hypo doens't know what kind of file you're uploading
              it will default to treating it as a text file.
            </p>

        <div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3">
          <h3 id="sec-1-2">Viewing</h3>
          <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
            <p>
              All files can be viewed (from, for example, your web
              browser) in three different ways. The regularly, raw and
              as download.
            </p>

            <p>
              The regular way shows a web page with the file either
              syntax highlighted using <code>pygments</code> or (in
              case it is an image) with the image shown on the page.
              This is viewed by using the URL printed after upload has
              completed. For example:
            </p>

            <pre class="example">http://yourserver.example.com/abcdef1</pre>

            <p>
              The raw view is just the file, saving this file is the
              same as downloading it. This is viewed by prefixing the
              last part of the URL with <code>raw/</code>. For
              example:
            </p>

            <pre class="example">http://yourserver.example.com/raw/abcdef1</pre>

            <p>
              The download view is the same as the raw view except
              that the <code>Content-Disposition</code> header has
              been set to <code>attachment</code>. This causes a
              download dialog to show up instead of your browser
              trying to render it. This ir viewed by prefixing the
              last part of the URL with <code>dl/</code>. For example:
            </p>

            <pre class="example">http://yourserver.example.com/dl/abcdef1</pre>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3">
          <h3 id="sec-1-3">Deleting</h3>
          <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
            <p>
              After you have uploaded a file you can delete it again
              by using the <code>DELETE</code> HTTP method. An example
              with curl:
            </p>

            <pre class="example"># curl -XDELETE http://yourserver.example.com/abcdef1
None</pre>

            <p>
              There is currently no way to authenticate yourself with
              the server, so anyone can delete (also post) files. Of
              course they would first have to know the URL to send the
              delete to.
            </p>

            Hypo tries to stay simple to work with, at least on the
            client-side. However, some clients may make things easier.
            Currently there is only the
            (incomplete) <a href="http://code.ryuslash.org/hypo-emacs/">Emacs
            client</a>.
